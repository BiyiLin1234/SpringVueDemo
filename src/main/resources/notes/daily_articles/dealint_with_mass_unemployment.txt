You and I are lucky, Sam, because we can do our jobs remotely, working from home.
There are some downsides, though, like not being out to meet up with our friends and share ideas with colleagues.
And going out for launch.
But the coronavirus pendamic has caused millions of people to lose their job, and forced thousands more out of work temporarily with no idea if their job would still be there when they return.
For those daily workers without savings to pay their rent and feed their families it has been especially stressful.
Each job loss is a potential personal tragedy.
In this program, we will be assessing the post-covid job landscape and asking whether a radical new approch is needed to prevent global mass unemployment.
We will be asking one of the world's smallest and richeast country, Denmark, might hold the answer.
And of course we be learning some new vocabulary as well.
But first it's time for our quiz question.
One man who knows a lot about jobs is Brad Smith, president of Microsoft, a company employing over 150 thousand workers.
He's made gloomy predictions about the number of people out of work, but how many people does he predict will be left unemployed this year as the result of coronavirus pendemic.
Is it, a) one quote of a billion people. b) one third of a billion people. or c) half of a billion people.
Well these numbers do really looks gloomy.
I'll say b) one third of a billion people unemploye around the world.
